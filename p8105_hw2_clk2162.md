Join the datasets by mergine snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
# Merge snp_df into pols_df

pols_snp_df <- left_join(pols_df, snp_df)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

``` r
# Merge unemployment data in as well

pols_snp_unemployment_df <- left_join(pols_snp_df, unemployment_df)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

``` r
pols_snp_unemployment_df <- pols_snp_unemployment_df %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

The dataset contains the following variables: year, month, gov_gop,
sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close,
unemployment. It describes the date, the numbers of senators, governors,
and representatives in each of the two parties democrat or repliacn
(gop), as well as whether the president is democrat or replican, the snp
closing numbers, and the unemployment numbers. The years range from 1947
to 2015.

## Problem 2

Mr. Trash Wheel!

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_df <- readxl::read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                                        range = "A2:N586") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) %>% 
  mutate(which_wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

prof_trash_wheel_df <- readxl::read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                        sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
                                        range = "A2:M108") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) %>% 
  mutate(which_wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel")
  
  # Note that Professor Trash Wheel does not have sports balls as a column

# Import and clean Gwynnda
gwyn_trash_wheel_df <- readxl::read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                        sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
                                        range = "A2:L157") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) %>% 
  mutate(which_wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel")
```

Combine datasets into a single, tidy dataset.

``` r
# Combine the three datasets

trash_wheel_combined_df <- 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df, prof_trash_wheel_df, gwyn_trash_wheel_df)
```

The data contains information on three trash wheels: Mr. Trash Wheel,
Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda. There are a total of 845
observations. It has information on the following variables: dumpster,
month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers,
sports_balls, homes_powered, which_wheel. This describes the dumpster,
date, weight and volume of the trash collected, and some details on what
the trash is composed of (plastic bottles, polystrene, cigarette butts,
glass bottles, plastic bags, wrappers, and sports balls, although some
variables such as `sports_balls` are not available for every trash
wheel), as well as the equivalent homes powered, by the formula that
each ton of trash equates to on average 500 kilowatts of electricity and
that an average household will use 30 kilowatts per day. The total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel was 216.26 tons. The
total number of cigarettes butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021
was 1.63^{4}.

## Question 3

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers and MCI

#### Import, clean, and tidy the baseline demographics dataset, then describe it.

``` r
mci_baseline_df <- read_csv("./data/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) %>% # The first column contains descriptions, so needs to be skipped to enable the column names in the df to be correct
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex,
                          1 ~ "male",
                          0 ~ "female"
                          )) %>% 
  mutate(apoe4 = case_match(apoe4,
                            1 ~ "carrier",
                            0 ~ "noncarrier"
                            )) %>% 
  filter(!(age_at_onset <= current_age) | age_at_onset == ".") # Filter out subjects who had MCI at baseline
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
# Number of participants recruited who meet inclusion criteria

num_participants <- mci_baseline_df %>% 
  filter(age_at_onset > current_age) %>% 
  summarise(n())

# Number of participants who develop MCI

num_mci <- mci_baseline_df %>% 
  filter(age_at_onset > current_age) %>% 
  summarise(n())

# Proportion of women who are APOE4 carriers

prop_women_apoe4 <- mci_baseline_df %>% 
  filter(sex == "female") %>% 
  summarise(mean(apoe4 == "carrier"))
```

Importing baseline data: The original CSV had the first column as the
description of the data, so needed to be skipped when imported. The
column names were standardized with janitor::cleannames() for easier
analysis. Additionally, sex and carrier status were coded using 0 and 1,
so that was translated into words (male/female and carrier/noncarrier).
Finally, the dataset contained subjects who had MCI at baseline, which
is not what we are interested in for this analysis (they do not meet
inclusion criteria), so they were filtered out.

Features of baseline data: After filtering, 93 subjects met the
inclusion criterion of no MCI at baseline, of which 93 developed MCI.
The average baseline age was 65.0286013 years. The proportion of women
in the study who are APOE4 carriers is 0.3 (or 30%).

#### Import, clean, and tidy the longitudinally observed biomarkers dataset, then describe it.

The following dataset contains measures of amyloid 42/40 ratios over 5
timepoints.

``` r
mci_longitudinal_df <- read_csv("./data/data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer("baseline":"time_8",
               names_to = "timepoint",
               values_to = "ratio")
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
# In order to explore the overlap of subjects who appear in both datasets, we will use a wide format and inner_join. The longitudinal dataset is in wide format when importing, so we will import it, clean it, but not tidy it, and change the name of the column for study id to match the baseline dataset.

mci_longitudinal_df_wide <- read_csv("./data/data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(id = study_id)
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
# Merge the two dfs
mci_merged_df <- inner_join(mci_baseline_df, mci_longitudinal_df_wide, by = "id")

# Count the number of subjects that did not overlap
non_overlap <- anti_join(mci_baseline_df, mci_longitudinal_df_wide, by = "id") %>%
  summarise(n())

# Create a tidy version of the merged data
mci_merged_df_tidy <- mci_merged_df %>% 
    pivot_longer("baseline":"time_8",
               names_to = "timepoint",
               values_to = "ratio")

# Save merged, tidy dataset
write_csv(mci_merged_df_tidy, "./data/data_mci/mci_merged.csv")
```

Data import and merging: The longitudinal csv is in a wide format, so it
was tidyed. However, in order to combine the longitudinal with the
baseline df, the wide format was needed and the study_id/id column had
to have the same name. Once they were compatible, they were merged over
the common subjects using inner_join. The total number of subjects in
the baseline df was 479, the total number in the longitudinal df were
487, and the total number (overlapping) in the merged df was 471.
Although 8 subjects did not appear in both datasets, the majority
overlapped.

Exported dataset csv: The exported, merged, tidied dataset contains the
information from both datasets. It describes id, current_age, sex,
education, apoe4, age_at_onset, timepoint, ratio. This includes the
subject study id, their age at baseline, education, whether they are a
carrier of APOE4 or not, the age at onset of MCI if applicable, and the
amyloid 42/40 ratio at baseline and four time points. It is in a long,
tidy form.
