Import and clean data from fivethirtyeight datasets of interest.

``` r

# note that the mutate method for prez_dem == 1 or == 0 was chosen because of the code book, and because there exists values of "2" in prez_gop, which does not agree with the code book. Here we are assuming that prez_rep = 2 and prez_dem = 0 means that the president was republican.

Join the datasets by mergine snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
# Merge snp_df into pols_df

pols_snp_df <- left_join(pols_df, snp_df)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

``` r
# Merge unemployment data in as well

pols_snp_unemployment_df <- left_join(pols_snp_df, unemployment_df)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

``` r
pols_snp_unemployment_df <- pols_snp_unemployment_df %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

The dataset contains the following variables: year, month, gov_gop,
sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close,
unemployment. It describes the date, the numbers of senators, governors,
and representatives in each of the two parties democrat or repliacn
(gop), as well as whether the president is democrat or replican, the snp
closing numbers, and the unemployment numbers. The years range from 1947
to 2015.

## Problem 2

Mr. Trash Wheel!

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_df <- readxl::read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                                        range = "A2:N586") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
# The homework now says to omit rows that do not include dumpster specific data, but I think they all do?
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) %>% 
  mutate(which_wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

prof_trash_wheel_df <- readxl::read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                        sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
                                        range = "A2:M108") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
# The homework now says to omit rows that do not include dumpster specific data, but I think they all do?
#  filter(is.na(x)) ?????????????
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) %>% 
  mutate(which_wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel")
  
  # Note that Professor Trash Wheel does not have sports balls as a column

gwyn_trash_wheel_df <- readxl::read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                        sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
                                        range = "A2:L157") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
# The homework now says to omit rows that do not include dumpster specific data, but I think they all do?
#  filter(is.na(x)) ?????????????
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) %>% 
  mutate(which_wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel")
```

Combine datasets into a single, tidy dataset

``` r
# Not sure how to do this because some columns are missing 

trash_wheel_combined_df <- 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df, prof_trash_wheel_df, gwyn_trash_wheel_df)
```

\<PARAGRAPH ABOUT MR. TRASH WHEEL\> Write a paragraph about these data;
you are encouraged to use inline R. Be sure to note the number of
observations in the resulting dataset, and give examples of key
variables. For available data, what was the total weight of trash
collected by Professor Trash Wheel? What was the total number of
cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021?

## Question 3

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers and MCI

Import, clean, and tidy the baseline demographics dataset.

``` r
mci_baseline_df <- read_csv("./data/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) %>% # The first column contains descriptions, so needs to be skipped to enable the column names in the df to be correct
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex,
                          1 ~ "male",
                          0 ~ "female"
                          )) %>% 
  mutate(apoe4 = case_match(apoe4,
                            1 ~ "carrier",
                            0 ~ "noncarrier"
                            )) %>% 
  filter(!(age_at_onset <= current_age) | age_at_onset == ".") # Filter out subjects who had MCI at baseline
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
# Number of participants recruited who meet inclusion criteria

num_participants <- mci_baseline_df %>% 
  filter(age_at_onset > current_age) %>% 
  summarise(n())

# Number of participants who develop MCI

num_mci <- mci_baseline_df %>% 
  summarise(mean(current_age))

# Proportion of women who are APOE4 carriers

prop_women_apoe4 <- mci_baseline_df %>% 
  filter(sex == "female") %>% 
  summarise(mean(apoe4 == "carrier"))

female_total <- nrow(mci_baseline_df %>% 
  filter(sex == "female"))
female_carrier <- nrow(mci_baseline_df %>% 
  filter(sex == "female") %>%
  filter(apoe4 == "carrier"))
prop_women_apoe4_bruteforce <- female_carrier/female_total
```

Importing baseline data: The original CSV had the first column as the
description of the data, so needed to be skipped when imported. The
column names were standardized with janitor::cleannames() for easier
analysis. Additionally, sex and carrier status were coded using 0 and 1,
so that was translated into words (male/female and carrier/noncarrier).
Finally, the dataset contained subjects who had MCI at baseline, which
is not what we are interested in for this analysis (they do not meet
inclusion criteria), so they were filtered out.

Features of baseline data: After filtering, 479 subjects met the
inclusion criterion of no MCI at baseline, of which 93 developed MCI.
The average baseline age was 65.0286013 years. The proportion of women
in the study who are APOE4 carriers is 0.3 (or 30%).
